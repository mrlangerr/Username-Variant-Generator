## ‚ú® Description

The **Username Variant Generator** is a straightforward yet powerful **Python utility script** designed to help you generate a comprehensive list of potential usernames.

Whether you're looking to secure a consistent handle across multiple social media platforms, create a list for a security audit, or just need creative suggestions, this tool efficiently combines a base name with a set of predefined roles, keywords, and common delimiters to maximize your chances of finding an available username.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The script generates username variants by:

1.  Taking a **primary input name** (e.g., "johnsmith").
2.  Combining the name with an internal or custom list of **roles, keywords, and suffixes** (e.g., "dev", "official", "real", "gaming").
3.  Applying common **separators and modifiers** (e.g., `_`, `-`, `.`, numbers) to create a vast array of unique combinations.
